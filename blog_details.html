                        <p><strong>Explanation  of Vision and Mission Statements</strong><br>
                          In  the vision statement we have two very important terms which will determine our  activities in the long run, namely platform and sustainable initiatives. As we  can see that we want to find out some sustainable solutions to the social  problems and ensure its execution through a platform. <br>
                          So  let us understand what do we mean by sustainable initiatives. We want to  develop such initiatives which ensure the improvement of the social, economic  and environmental conditions of an area and last long. We aim to make them  sustainable by using local resources and long term impact. Then after being  able to successfully develop and implement some potential solutions in our  headquarter, i.e. Kharagpur, we should try to implement those solutions  throughout the country. This will be done through a platform which will be made  to ensure proper implementation of the solutions and help to contribute to  collective growth of each node of the network. In this platform we will be  targeting the working individuals</p>

                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>            </strong>We have identified some initiatives which can make a  longer impact on society. <br>
                          Following are  the initiatives under PRAYAS:</p>
                        <ol>

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>2.1 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</strong><br>

                        <p><strong>2.2 INTERNSHIP PROGRAM</strong><br>
                          In  this initiative creative minds from various institutes are chosen for  identifying issues of society and finding the respective solution for the same.  Youth and creative mind from different institute will be selected and these  youth will be trained by highly qualified experienced Professors of IIT  Kharagpur</p>

                          It  is  the channel to put the budding managers on the track of social work. The  project involves selecting the potential candidates from various institutes.  Giving them the liberty to work on a problem and expanding the scope of the  work to adoption of a particular region and support the region in its  development.</p>

This program aims at taking steps and  making people aware about the steps which can reduce global warming and its  effects. </p>
                        <p><strong>2.5 </strong><strong>EARN A SMILE</strong><br>

                        <p><strong>CONCLUSION :</strong><br>
                          We propose the following solutions should be  implemented as soon as possible.<br>
                          First , there must be an international  political solution.<br>
                          Second, funding for developing cheap and clean  energy production must be increased, as all economic development is based on  increasing energy usage. We must not pin all our hopes on global politics and  clean energy technology, so we must prepare for the worst and adapt . if  implemented now, a lot of the costs and damage that could be caused by changing  climate can be mitigated.</p>

                            <strong>EARN A SMILE</strong> <br>
                            <strong>AIM: </strong>India is home to  millions of poor people who have limited means in life. Some even struggle to  get the basic needs in life, viz. food, water, clothing and shelter. Despite  considerable progress made in the socio economic sphere since independence,  even today, more than 23.4% of India’s   population lives below the poverty line, as per the World Bank figures. <br>
                          Those children who belong to the below poverty  line, do not have access to education and good food and shelter. Through this  initiative we want to shape their future for good and earn a smile on those  children’s faces.</p>
                        <p><strong>EXECUTION:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>We will identify such children who are not  going to school or not having home</li>
                          <li>We will get them admitted to a school and bear  all the expense of their education</li>
                          <li>We will provide them with books, uniforms and  school bags to study.</li>
                          <li>The homeless children will be shifted to  hostels and good food will be provided to them.</li>
